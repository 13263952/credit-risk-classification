# credit-risk-classification

Through the implementation of different techniques, this sample demonstrates the training and evaluation of a model based on loan risk. A historical lending activity report was used from a csv file. 

The sample was analysed and concluded after:

- Data was split into Training and Testing Sets

- A Logisitic Regression Model was created and predicted with original Data and Resampled Training Data.
